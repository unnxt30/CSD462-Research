# Comparative Analysis: Weighted A3C vs Standard A3C

## 1. Introduction

This report analyzes the differences, performance characteristics, and improvements between two implementations of the Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm: a standard implementation and an enhanced weighted implementation designed for cloud job scheduling with priority awareness and fairness constraints. The analysis includes recent improvements in fairness metrics, adaptive reward weights, and comprehensive performance evaluation.

## 2. Implementation Differences

### 2.1 Core Architectural Differences

| Feature | Standard A3C | Enhanced Weighted A3C |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Neural Network Architecture | Shared layers with policy and value heads | Same architecture with enhanced priority-aware action selection |
| Action Selection | Standard softmax policy | Time-aware priority-weighted softmax policy |
| State Representation | Basic environment state | Enhanced state with priority and time information |
| Reward Function | Two-factor (QoS, Energy) | Adaptive four-factor (QoS, Energy, Priority, Fairness) |
| Fairness Mechanism | None | Multi-dimensional fairness with starvation prevention |
| Performance Tracking | Basic metrics | Comprehensive metrics with statistical analysis |

### 2.2 Enhanced Reward Formulation

**Standard A3C Reward:**
```
reward = (0.5 * normalized_latency) + (0.5 * normalized_energy)
```

**Enhanced Weighted A3C Reward:**
```
# Adaptive weights based on system state
w_qos, w_energy, w_priority, w_fairness = adaptive_reward_weights(state, history)

# Non-linear reward combination
reward = sqrt(w_qos * norm_latency² + w_energy * norm_energy² + w_priority * norm_priority²) - fairness_penalty
```

### 2.3 Multi-Dimensional Fairness

The enhanced implementation introduces a sophisticated fairness calculation that considers:

1. **Priority-based Fairness**:
   - Variance in priority handling
   - Priority distribution analysis
   - Weighted priority consideration

2. **Time-based Fairness**:
   - Prevention of job starvation
   - Time-aware priority adjustment
   - Historical allocation tracking

3. **Resource Allocation Fairness**:
   - Distribution of resources
   - Utilization patterns
   - Load balancing considerations

### 2.4 Adaptive Weighting System

The enhanced implementation features a dynamic weight adjustment system that:

1. **Responds to System Load**:
   - High load (>80%): Prioritizes QoS over energy
   - Low load (<20%): Prioritizes energy efficiency
   - Normal load: Balanced optimization

2. **Learns from History**:
   - Tracks recent performance
   - Adjusts weights based on fairness trends
   - Adapts to changing workload patterns

3. **Maintains Balance**:
   - Normalizes weights to ensure consistency
   - Prevents extreme bias
   - Maintains system stability
