# A3C Algorithm Analysis: Standard vs Weighted Implementation

## 1. Algorithm Overview

### 1.1 Standard A3C Implementation

The standard A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic) implementation follows the classic architecture:

```python
class StandardA3C:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, lr=0.001):
        self.model = ActorCritic(state_dim, action_dim)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=lr)
        self.gamma = 0.99  # Discount factor
        self.entropy_coef = 0.01  # Entropy coefficient for exploration
```

Key components:
1. **Actor-Critic Network**: Shared network with two heads:
   - Actor: Policy head for action selection
   - Critic: Value head for state-value estimation
2. **Reward Function**: Simple two-factor reward:
   ```python
   reward = (0.5 * normalized_latency) + (0.5 * normalized_energy)
   ```
3. **Action Selection**: Standard softmax policy without priority consideration
4. **Training**: Uses advantage estimation and entropy regularization

### 1.2 Weighted A3C Implementation

The weighted A3C extends the standard implementation with priority awareness and fairness constraints:

```python
class WeightedA3C:
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, lr=0.001):
        self.model = ActorCritic(state_dim, action_dim)
        self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=lr)
        self.gamma = 0.99
        self.entropy_coef = 0.01
        self.history = []
        self.time_since_allocation = {}
```

Key enhancements:
1. **Priority-Aware Action Selection**:
   ```python
   norm_priority = priority / 5.0
   time_factor = np.exp(-self.time_since_allocation.get(priority.item(), 0) / 100)
   priority_bias = norm_priority * time_factor
   probs = torch.softmax(logits + priority_bias, dim=-1)
   ```

2. **Enhanced Reward Function**:
   ```python
   # Adaptive weights based on system state
   w_qos, w_energy, w_priority, w_fairness = adaptive_reward_weights(state, history, cpu_utilization)
   
   # Non-linear reward combination
   reward = sqrt(w_qos * norm_latency² + w_energy * norm_energy² + w_priority * norm_priority²) - fairness_penalty
   ```

3. **Fairness Mechanism**:
   - Multi-dimensional fairness calculation
   - Time-based priority adjustment
   - Resource allocation tracking

## 2. Performance Metrics Analysis

### 2.1 Raw Rewards
- **Definition**: Cumulative reward obtained in each episode
- **Interpretation**: Direct measure of policy quality
- **Calculation**: Sum of all rewards in an episode
- **Significance**: Shows immediate performance without smoothing

### 2.2 Moving Average Rewards
- **Definition**: Rolling average of rewards over a window (default: 10 episodes)
- **Formula**: 
  ```python
  moving_avg = np.mean(rewards[episode-window_size+1:episode+1])
  ```
- **Purpose**: Reduces noise and shows learning trends
- **Window Size**: 10 episodes (configurable)

### 2.3 Aggregate Statistics
1. **Mean Reward**:
   - Average performance across all episodes
   - Indicates overall policy effectiveness

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   - Measures consistency of performance
   - Lower values indicate more stable learning

3. **Min/Max Rewards**:
   - Shows performance range
   - Helps identify best and worst cases

### 2.4 Improvement Metrics
1. **Raw Reward Improvement**:
   ```python
   ((weighted_rewards[-1] - standard_rewards[-1]) / standard_rewards[-1] * 100)
   ```
   - Percentage improvement in final episode reward

2. **Moving Average Improvement**:
   - Percentage improvement in smoothed performance

3. **Mean Reward Improvement**:
   - Overall performance improvement across all episodes

## 3. Why Weighted A3C Performs Better

   - Dynamically adjusts based on system state
   - Responds to load conditions
   - Balances multiple objectives

2. **Non-linear Combination**:
   - Better captures complex relationships
   - Prevents single metric dominance
   - More balanced optimization

3. **Fairness Consideration**:
   - Explicit fairness penalties
   - Multi-dimensional fairness metrics
   - Better long-term resource distribution

### 3.3 Learning Improvements
